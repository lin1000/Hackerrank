- [x] 0005 (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-lambda-expressions/problem)
- [x] 0006 Find Number
- [x] 0007 Java 1D Array Part 2 (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-1d-array)
- [x] 0008 (java8 stream) IntStream and Collectors
- [x] 0009 (java8 stream parallel) MyParallel
- [x] 0010 (data structure) dive into hashmap
- [x] 0011 (data structure) UniqueCharacter
- [x] 0012 (data structure) Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the 
- [x] 0013 (data structure) ReplaceSpce, such as generate a urlencoded string from user typed url string
- [x] 0014 (data structure) Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become
a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original
string, your method should return the original string.
- [-] 0015 (data strtucture) implement a double liked LinkedList array
- [x] 0016 (design pattern) classic template method by inheritance 
- [x] 0017 (design pattern) template method by lambda (more flexible on delegation - not limit to inheritance hierarchy only )
